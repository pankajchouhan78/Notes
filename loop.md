# Python Loop-based Interview Questions

Loops are used to perform repetitive tasks in Python. There are two types of loops in Python.
- For loop
- While loop

## What is the difference between a 'for' loop and a 'while' loop in Python?

- **For loop**: Used when we know how many times we want to iterate over a block of code.
- **While loop**: Used when we donâ€™t know beforehand how many times we need to loop. It continues to execute as long as the specified condition is `True`.

## How do you terminate a loop prematurely in Python?

You can use the **`break`** statement to terminate a loop prematurely. 
- **`break`** is a keyword primarily used to exit the loop when a specified condition is met.

## What is the purpose of the 'continue' statement in Python?

The **`continue`** statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration.

## What is the purpose of the 'else' clause in a loop in Python?

The **`else`** clause in a loop is optional and is executed when the loop condition becomes `False`. It is not executed if the loop is terminated using a **`break`** statement.
