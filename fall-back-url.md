In Django, the fallback URL method usually refers to handling cases where a user tries to access a view that does not exist or an invalid URL is requested. Instead of showing a standard 404 page, you might want to redirect users to a fallback URL for specific handling.

Here’s how you can implement a fallback URL in Django:

### 1. Using urls.py

You can define a catch-all URL pattern at the end of your urls.py file. This should be placed after all your other URL patterns to ensure that it only catches URLs that haven’t been matched by the other patterns.

```python
from django.urls import path, re_path
from django.shortcuts import redirect

urlpatterns = [
re_path(r'^.*$', lambda request: redirect('fallback_view_name'), name='fallback'),
]
```
  

### 2. Create the Fallback View

You need to create a view that will handle the fallback logic. This view can redirect to a specific page, show a custom message, or log the original request.

```python

from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
def  fallback_view(request):
  return redirect('some_other_view') # Or render a template

```  

### 3. Set Up URLs for the Fallback View

Make sure to include your fallback view in your URL configurations:

```python

urlpatterns = [
path('fallback/', fallback_view, name='fallback_view_name'),
]
```
  

### 4. Custom Error Handling

You could also handle 404 errors directly in views.py using handler404. If you want to render a custom 404 page and then redirect, you could do something like this:

```python

from django.http import HttpResponseNotFound
from django.shortcuts import redirect

def  custom_404_view(request, exception):
   return redirect('fallback_view_name') # Redirect to fallback when a 404 occurs
```

### Assign the custom handler
handler404 = custom_404_view
