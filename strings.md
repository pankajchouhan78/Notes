## Python String-Based Interview Questions

### 1. What is a string in Python?
A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes. Strings can be defined using single quotes (`''`), double quotes (`""`), or triple quotes (`"""`).

### 2. How do you find the length of a string?
You can use the `len()` function to find the length of a string.

### 3. How do you access individual characters in a string?
Individual characters in a string can be accessed using indexing, starting from 0.

### 4. Can you change a character in a string?
No, strings in Python are immutable, which means you cannot change individual characters. You need to create a new string.

### 5. How do you repeat a string multiple times?
You can use the `*` operator to repeat a string.

### 6. How do you check if a string contains a substring?
You can use the `in` keyword to check if a substring is present in a string.

### 7. How do you split a string into a list of substrings?
You can use the `split()` method to split a string based on a delimiter and return a list of substrings.

### 8. How do you join a list of strings into a single string?
You can use the `join()` method to join a list of strings into a single string using a specified delimiter.

### 9. How do you remove leading and trailing whitespace from a string?
You can use the `strip()` method to remove leading and trailing whitespace from a string.

### 10. How do you check if a string starts with a specific substring?
You can use the `startswith()` method to check if a string starts with a specific substring.

### 11. How do you check if a string ends with a specific substring?
