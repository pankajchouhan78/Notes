## What is Python?
Python is a programming language with objects, modules, exceptions and automatic memory management. Python is designed to be highly readable. It used English keywords frequently whereas other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.

## What are the benefits of using python?
The benefits of python are that it is simple and easy, portable, extensible, build in data structure and it is open- source.
Python ko portable mana jata hai kyun ki ye platform-independent hai. Iska matlab hai ki Python code ko alag-alag operating systems par bina kisi modification ke chalaaya ja sakta hai.
Python dusre languages jaise C aur C++ mein likhe gaye modules aur packages ko integrate karne ko support karta hai.

## Features of python:
it’s easy to learn.
it is portable means we can install it in any plateform.
it is object-oriented language.

## Python is a open source so why? 
becouse python is free of cost we don't need to pay..

## Where Python Is Used?
Python used in many technologies:
- Web development, Game development:
- Artificial intelligence and machine learning:
- Data science and Analytics:

## What is programming language?
programming language is a way of communication between computer and human.

## Category of programming languages:
- Scripting: [js, python] jo do not generate dot exe file is called.
- Non scripting: [c, c++, java] jo generate kare dot exe file ko.
- Tag support: [html, xml]

# What is ‘PIP’?

In Python, **pip** is the default package manager used to install, manage, and uninstall Python packages. It helps you easily install third-party libraries and tools, such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `requests`, etc., from the **Python Package Index (PyPI)**. `pip` simplifies the process of managing dependencies for your projects.

## Key Functions of pip:
- **Install a package:**  
  ```bash
  pip install <package_name>
  ```
- **Uninstall a package:**  
  ```bash
  pip uninstall <package_name>
  ```
- **List installed packages:**  
  ```bash
  pip list
  ```
- **Upgrade a package:**  
  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade <package_name>


# Difference Between .py and .pyc

| **.py** | **.pyc** |
|---------|---------|
| `.py` files are the original source code files that contain the readable Python code. | `.pyc` files are compiled bytecode files generated by the Python interpreter. |


# Difference Between Python 2.0 & Python 3.0

| Aspect              | Python 2.0                                  | Python 3.0                                          |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Release Date**    | Released in 2000                          | Released in 2008                                  |
| **Syntax**         | Some syntax is different from Python 3     | Introduced many improvements and changes to syntax |
| **Print Statement** | `print` is a statement (no parentheses required) | `print` is a function (requires parentheses) |
| **Integer Division**| Integer division returns an integer (e.g., `5 / 2 = 2`) | Integer division returns a float (e.g., `5 / 2 = 2.5`) |
| **Unicode**        | Text is stored as ASCII by default (need to define Unicode) | Text is stored as Unicode by default |
| **Iterators**      | Functions like `range()`, `map()`, and `filter()` return lists | These functions return iterators (lazy evaluation) |
| **Exception Handling** | `except` uses a comma (e.g., `except Exception, e:`) | `except` uses `as` keyword (e.g., `except Exception as e:`) |
| **Input Function**  | `input()` evaluates user input as Python code | `input()` always returns input as a string |
| **Library Support** | Many libraries still support Python 2.x | Python 3 has become the standard, and new libraries support only Python 3 |
| **End of Life**     | Python 2 reached its official end of life in 2020 | Python 3 is the current version, actively maintained |


# What are Modules?

In Python, **modules** are individual `.py` files that contain Python code, such as functions, classes, and variables. Modules help in organizing and reusing code efficiently by breaking down the code into smaller, manageable parts.

## Types of Modules in Python

There are three types of modules in Python:

### 1. User-Defined Modules  
These are modules that you create yourself, typically as a part of your project.  
For example, you may have a file `utils.py` containing utility functions that can be imported and used in multiple parts of your code.

### 2. Predefined Modules  
These are **built-in modules** that come with Python and are available without any installation. Some examples include:

- **`os`**: Provides functions to interact with the operating system (e.g., file manipulation).
- **`sys`**: Contains system-specific parameters and functions.
- **`calendar`**: Provides functions to work with dates and calendars.
- **`datetime`**: Helps to work with dates and times.

### 3. External Modules  
These are modules that are not part of the Python standard library and need to be installed separately using `pip`. Some popular external modules include:

- **`numpy`**: A powerful library for numerical computing.
- **`requests`**: A simple HTTP library for making API requests.
- **`pandas`**: A data manipulation and analysis library.

To install an external module, use:

```bash
pip install module_name
```
# Difference Between Modules and Packages in Python

## Module vs Package

| Aspect            | Module                                            | Package |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------|
| **Definition**   | A module is a single `.py` file containing functions, classes, and objects. | A package is a directory that contains multiple modules and an `__init__.py` file. |
| **Purpose**      | Modules are used for code reuse by grouping related code into one file. | A package helps organize related modules together in a directory. |
| **Example**      | `my_module.py` with functions and classes. | A directory `my_package/` containing `module1.py`, `module2.py`, and `__init__.py`. |
| **Importing**    | A module can be imported using `import module_name`. | A package can be imported using `from package_name import module_name`. |

## Example of a Module and Package in a Single File

```python
# This is a single file demonstrating both a module and a package.

# Example of a Module
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

def square(x):
    return x ** 2

# Example of a Package (Simulated within the same file)
class MyPackage:
    class Module1:
        @staticmethod
        def greet(name):
            print("Hello, " + name + "!")

    class Module2:
        @staticmethod
        def square(x):
            return x ** 2

# Using the Module
print("Using Module:")
greet("Alice")
print(square(4))

# Using the Package Simulation
print("\nUsing Package Simulation:")
pkg = MyPackage()
pkg.Module1.greet("Bob")
print(pkg.Module2.square(5))
```
# Keywords in Python

A **keyword** refers to a reserved word with a special meaning in a programming language. Keywords are part of the language syntax and cannot be used as variable names, function names, or any other identifiers.

## Keywords in Python

- In **Python 3.9**, there were **35 keywords**.
- In **Python 3.10**, there were **36 keywords** (with the introduction of `match`).

### Common Python Keywords:
Some of the most commonly used Python keywords include:

- **Control Flow:** `if`, `else`, `elif`, `while`, `for`
- **Function & Class Definitions:** `def`, `class`, `return`
- **Exception Handling:** `try`, `except`, `finally`, `raise`
- **Importing Modules:** `import`, `from`, `as`
- **Logical Operations:** `and`, `or`, `not`, `in`, `is`
- **Variable & Scope Management:** `global`, `nonlocal`, `del`
- **New in Python 3.10:** `match` (introduced for structural pattern matching)

## List of Python 3.10 Keywords
You can check all the keywords in Python using:

```python
import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)
```

## What are constants in Python?
 Python does not have built-in support for constants, but by convention, variables that should not be changed are written in all uppercase to indicate they are constants.
```python
PI = 3.14159  # A constant by convention
```
While Python does not enforce immutability for constants, developers follow this convention to signify that a value should not be changed.


## What is the del keyword used for in Python?
 The del keyword is used to delete a variable, item from a list, or key-value pair from a dictionary. After a variable is deleted, it can no longer be accessed.
python

### Example: Deleting a variable
```python
x = 10
del x  # x is now deleted and cannot be used again
print(x)  # This will raise a NameError

Example: Deleting from a list:
python

lst = [1, 2, 3]
del lst[1]  # Removes the element at index 1
print(lst)  # Output: [1, 3]
```

## What is the difference between None and False in Python?

None is a special constant in Python that represents the absence of a value or a null value. It is often used to signify that a variable has not been assigned a meaningful value.
False is a Boolean value representing a logical "false" condition.
Although both None and False are considered "falsy" (they evaluate to False in a Boolean context), they are not the same.
```python

x = None
y = False

print(x == y)  # False because None and False are different
print(bool(x))  # False because None is falsy
print(bool(y))  # False because False is falsy
```
